# Task: Change Management and Course Correction

**Persona**: Orchestrator  
**Phase**: Any (triggered by change events)  
**Prerequisites**: Active project with documented requirements, change trigger event

## Objective
Guide structured response to project changes, assess impacts, and create actionable change proposals that maintain project integrity.

## Process

### 1. Change Assessment
- [ ] Document the change trigger and its source
- [ ] Understand the scope and urgency of the change
- [ ] Identify stakeholders affected by the change
- [ ] Assess immediate risks if change is not addressed

### 2. Impact Analysis
- [ ] Review impact on current sprint and active stories
- [ ] Analyze effects on project scope and MVP definition
- [ ] Evaluate impact on architecture and technical decisions
- [ ] Assess effects on timelines and resource requirements

### 3. Artifact Review
- [ ] Check impacts on PRD and requirements
- [ ] Review effects on epic and story definitions
- [ ] Evaluate impacts on architecture documentation
- [ ] Assess effects on design specifications and user flows

### 4. Options Evaluation
- [ ] Identify potential response options
- [ ] Evaluate trade-offs for each option
- [ ] Consider implications for project goals and constraints
- [ ] Assess resource and timeline impacts

### 5. Change Proposal Development
- [ ] Recommend specific course of action
- [ ] Draft required changes to project artifacts
- [ ] Identify what needs to be updated immediately vs later
- [ ] Plan communication and implementation approach

### 6. Stakeholder Alignment
- [ ] Present change proposal to key stakeholders
- [ ] Address concerns and incorporate feedback
- [ ] Get explicit approval for recommended changes
- [ ] Document final decisions and rationale

## Change Categories

### Scope Changes
- [ ] New features or requirements added
- [ ] Existing features modified or removed
- [ ] Priority shifts in feature importance
- [ ] User needs or market conditions change

### Technical Changes
- [ ] Technology constraints or opportunities
- [ ] Architecture decisions need revision
- [ ] Integration requirements change
- [ ] Performance or security requirements shift

### Resource Changes
- [ ] Timeline constraints or opportunities
- [ ] Team capacity or skill changes
- [ ] Budget constraints or additional funding
- [ ] External dependency changes

### Quality Changes
- [ ] Definition of done modifications
- [ ] Testing strategy adjustments
- [ ] Compliance requirement changes
- [ ] User experience standard shifts

## Response Strategies

### Scope Adjustment
- [ ] Add features to future phases
- [ ] Remove lower-priority features from current scope
- [ ] Split features into smaller increments
- [ ] Adjust acceptance criteria for existing stories

### Technical Adaptation
- [ ] Modify architecture to accommodate new requirements
- [ ] Update technology choices with rationale
- [ ] Revise integration approaches
- [ ] Adjust non-functional requirements

### Timeline Management
- [ ] Extend timeline with stakeholder approval
- [ ] Reduce scope to meet original timeline
- [ ] Increase resources to maintain scope and timeline
- [ ] Split delivery into multiple phases

### Process Adjustment
- [ ] Modify development approach or methodology
- [ ] Update quality gates or definition of done
- [ ] Revise communication or review processes
- [ ] Adjust team roles or responsibilities

## Change Proposal Format

### Executive Summary
- [ ] Change description and rationale
- [ ] Recommended response and key decisions
- [ ] Impact on timeline, scope, and resources
- [ ] Next steps and approval requirements

### Detailed Impact Analysis
- [ ] Specific artifacts requiring updates
- [ ] Effects on active work and upcoming stories
- [ ] Technical implications and risks
- [ ] Resource and timeline adjustments needed

### Proposed Updates
- [ ] Specific changes to PRD sections
- [ ] Epic and story modifications
- [ ] Architecture document updates
- [ ] Process or quality standard changes

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Immediate actions required
- [ ] Sequencing of artifact updates
- [ ] Communication plan for team and stakeholders
- [ ] Validation and review checkpoints

## Deliverables
- Change impact assessment document
- Specific proposed updates to affected artifacts
- Implementation plan with timeline
- Stakeholder communication and approval records
- Updated project documentation reflecting approved changes

## Quality Validation
- [ ] All impacts identified and addressed
- [ ] Proposed changes maintain project integrity
- [ ] Stakeholder concerns incorporated
- [ ] Implementation plan is realistic and actionable

## Handoff Process
Major scope changes → Product Manager for requirement revision
Technical changes → Architect for design updates
Process changes → All personas for workflow adjustments
Implementation → Developer for execution of approved changes

## Notes
- Document all decisions and rationale for future reference
- Ensure changes align with overall project vision and goals
- Balance change accommodation with project stability
- Communicate changes clearly to all affected stakeholders
