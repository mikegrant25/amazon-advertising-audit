# Task: Execute Quality Checklist

**Persona**: Orchestrator  
**Phase**: Quality Gate (any phase)  
**Prerequisites**: Completed deliverable requiring validation

## Objective
Run structured quality validation using BMAD checklists to ensure deliverables meet standards before phase progression.

## Process

### 1. Checklist Selection
- [ ] Identify appropriate checklist for current deliverable
- [ ] Confirm checklist version and relevance
- [ ] Review checklist scope and requirements
- [ ] Prepare any supporting documentation needed

### 2. Systematic Validation
- [ ] Work through checklist items sequentially
- [ ] Validate each item against actual deliverable
- [ ] Document findings and evidence for each item
- [ ] Mark items as passed, failed, or not applicable

### 3. Gap Analysis
- [ ] Identify items that don't meet standards
- [ ] Assess severity and impact of each gap
- [ ] Determine if gaps are blockers or can be addressed later
- [ ] Document specific remediation needed

### 4. Remediation Planning
- [ ] Prioritize gaps by importance and effort
- [ ] Assign responsibility for addressing each gap
- [ ] Set timeline for gap resolution
- [ ] Plan re-validation after remediation

### 5. Stakeholder Review
- [ ] Present checklist results to relevant stakeholders
- [ ] Discuss any failed items and remediation plans
- [ ] Get approval to proceed or requirement to fix gaps
- [ ] Document final decisions and approvals

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Complete checklist with all findings
- [ ] Document any exceptions or deviations approved
- [ ] Update project documentation with validation status
- [ ] Archive checklist results for audit trail

## Available Checklists

### Product Management
- **pm-checklist.md**: PRD quality and completeness validation
- **po-master-checklist.md**: Product owner deliverable validation
- **story-draft-checklist.md**: User story quality validation
- **story-dod-checklist.md**: Story completion and definition of done

### Architecture & Design
- **architect-checklist.md**: Technical architecture quality validation
- **frontend-architecture-checklist.md**: Frontend design validation

### Process & Change
- **change-checklist.md**: Change impact and management validation

## Validation Approach

### Evidence-Based Assessment
- [ ] Review actual deliverable content
- [ ] Check against documented requirements
- [ ] Validate with stakeholder feedback
- [ ] Verify alignment with project goals

### Objective Evaluation
- [ ] Use clear pass/fail criteria where possible
- [ ] Document specific evidence for each assessment
- [ ] Avoid subjective judgments without rationale
- [ ] Consider both letter and spirit of requirements

### Risk-Based Prioritization
- [ ] Focus on items critical to project success
- [ ] Consider downstream impact of gaps
- [ ] Balance perfection with progress
- [ ] Identify must-fix vs nice-to-fix items

## Quality Standards

### Completeness
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Sufficient detail for intended audience
- [ ] All dependencies and assumptions documented
- [ ] Clear success criteria defined

### Clarity
- [ ] Unambiguous language and requirements
- [ ] Clear ownership and responsibilities
- [ ] Testable and measurable criteria
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout

### Alignment
- [ ] Consistent with project vision and goals
- [ ] Aligned with architecture and constraints
- [ ] Compatible with other project deliverables
- [ ] Meets stakeholder expectations

### Quality
- [ ] Professional presentation and format

- [ ] Appropriate level of detail
- [ ] Follows established templates and standards

## Deliverables
- Completed checklist with validation results
- Gap analysis with remediation recommendations
- Stakeholder approval or remediation plan
- Updated project documentation reflecting validation status

## Escalation Process
- Minor gaps → Document and plan remediation
- Major gaps → Block progression until resolved
- Scope issues → Escalate to Product Manager
- Technical issues → Escalate to Architect

## Handoff Process
Quality validation complete → Resume normal workflow progression
Gaps identified → Return to appropriate persona for remediation
Major issues → Escalate to relevant decision makers
Process complete → Update project status and continue

## Notes
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good - focus on critical quality
- Document rationale for any checklist items marked as not applicable
- Use checklists as guidance, not rigid rules
- Balance quality gates with development velocity
