# Create Test Strategy

**Persona**: QA Engineer  
**Phase**: Planning/Quality Assurance  
**Prerequisites**: PRD, Architecture documentation, Technology stack decisions

## Purpose
Define a comprehensive testing strategy that covers all aspects of quality assurance including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches. This strategy guides all development and ensures consistent testing practices across the project.

## Required Inputs
- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: `docs/prd.md`
- **System Architecture**: `docs/architecture.md`
- **Technical Stack**: Technology selections from architecture document
- **User Stories**: To understand critical user flows

## Key Activities

### 1. Review Context and Requirements
- Analyze PRD for quality requirements and acceptance criteria
- Review architecture for system complexity and testing challenges
- Understand technology stack and available testing tools
- Identify critical user journeys that must be tested

### 2. Define Testing Philosophy
**Testing Principles**:
- Quality is built in, not tested in
- Tests should be fast, reliable, and maintainable
- Prefer automated testing over manual testing
- Test coverage should focus on critical paths and business logic
- Tests serve as living documentation

**Quality Goals**:
- Define acceptable failure rates and performance criteria
- Establish criteria for release readiness
- Set quality metrics and monitoring approaches

### 3. Test Level Strategy
**Unit Testing**:
- **Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and small modules in isolation
- **Location**: Co-located with source files or parallel test directories
- **Coverage Target**: Focus on business logic, algorithms, edge cases
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, file system)
- **Tools**: Framework selection based on technology stack

**Integration Testing**:
- **Scope**: Component interactions, API endpoints, database operations
- **Environment**: Test databases, containerized dependencies, or test environment
- **Coverage**: Service layer interactions, data access patterns
- **Tools**: Testing frameworks with container support (Testcontainers, etc.)

**End-to-End Testing**:
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows from UI through backend
- **Critical Paths**: Primary user journeys from PRD
- **Error Scenarios**: Authentication failures, network issues, edge cases
- **Tools**: Browser automation (Playwright, Cypress) or API testing

### 4. Specialized Testing Strategies
**Performance Testing**:
- Load testing for expected traffic patterns
- Stress testing for peak capacity
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring

**Security Testing**:
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation and injection prevention
- API security and rate limiting

**Accessibility Testing**:
- WCAG compliance validation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation testing

### 5. Testing Environment Strategy
**Environment Setup**:
- Local development testing setup
- Continuous integration test environment
- Staging environment for integration testing
- Production-like testing for performance validation

**Test Data Management**:
- Test data creation and management strategy
- Data privacy and anonymization for testing
- Test database setup and maintenance

### 6. Quality Assurance Process
**Development Workflow**:
- Test-driven development (TDD) approach where appropriate
- Code review requirements including test review
- Definition of Done criteria including test completion

**Continuous Integration**:
- Automated test execution on code changes
- Test result reporting and failure notifications
- Quality gates preventing broken code deployment

**Release Testing**:
- Regression testing approach
- User acceptance testing process
- Production deployment validation

### 7. Testing Tools and Infrastructure
**Tool Selection**:
- Unit testing frameworks aligned with tech stack
- Integration testing tools and containerization
- E2E testing framework selection
- Test reporting and monitoring tools

**Infrastructure Requirements**:
- Test environment provisioning
- Test data management systems
- Performance monitoring and alerting

### 8. Quality Metrics and Monitoring
**Test Metrics**:
- Code coverage targets and measurement
- Test execution time and reliability
- Defect detection and resolution rates

**Quality Monitoring**:
- Production error rates and monitoring
- Performance metrics and alerting
- User experience monitoring

## Quality Framework

### Testing Checklist Integration
Ensure the test strategy aligns with:
- `test-suite-quality-checklist.md` - Test implementation standards
- `story-dod-checklist.md` - Story completion criteria
- `implementation-quality-checklist.md` - Code quality standards

### Test Strategy Documentation
Document the complete strategy including:
- Testing approach for each system component
- Tool selection rationale and configuration
- Environment setup and maintenance procedures
- Quality metrics and success criteria

## Deliverables
- **Comprehensive Test Strategy**: Detailed approach for all testing levels
- **Tool and Framework Selection**: Specific tools aligned with tech stack
- **Quality Metrics Definition**: Measurable criteria for testing success
- **Testing Process Integration**: How testing fits into development workflow
- **Updated Architecture Document**: Integration of testing strategy into system design

## Next Steps
After test strategy is complete:
1. Update architecture document with testing strategy section
2. Configure testing tools and environments
3. Create initial test suites for existing components
4. Integrate testing requirements into story templates
5. Train team on testing approaches and tools
