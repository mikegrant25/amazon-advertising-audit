# Task: Session Memory Core Dump

**Persona**: Orchestrator  
**Phase**: Session Management  
**Prerequisites**: Active session with completed work

## Objective
Create persistent session memory that enables seamless continuation of work across Claude Code sessions.

## Process

### 1. Session Assessment
- [ ] Review current session accomplishments
- [ ] Identify key decisions made during session
- [ ] Document current project state and phase
- [ ] Note any blocking issues or dependencies

### 2. Context Capture
- [ ] Document files created, modified, or deleted
- [ ] Record important conversations and decisions
- [ ] Capture current persona state and handoffs
- [ ] Note any changes to project direction or scope

### 3. Progress Documentation
- [ ] List completed tasks and deliverables
- [ ] Document work in progress with current status
- [ ] Identify next logical steps and priorities
- [ ] Note any assumptions or constraints discovered

### 4. State Preservation
- [ ] Record current position in BMAD workflow
- [ ] Document active stories or epics being worked
- [ ] Capture technical decisions and their rationale
- [ ] Note stakeholder feedback or approvals received

### 5. Future Session Preparation
- [ ] Identify what needs to be done next session
- [ ] Document any context the next session will need
- [ ] Note any files or information to review first
- [ ] Capture any specific user preferences or constraints

## Core Dump Structure

### Session Summary
- [ ] Session date and duration
- [ ] Primary persona(s) used during session
- [ ] Main objectives and outcomes
- [ ] Key accomplishments and deliverables

### Project State
- [ ] Current BMAD phase (Discovery, Design, Implementation)
- [ ] Active epic and story status
- [ ] Recent changes to scope or direction
- [ ] Current blockers or dependencies

### File Changes
- [ ] New files created with purpose
- [ ] Modified files with key changes
- [ ] Deleted files with rationale
- [ ] Important configuration or setup changes

### Key Decisions
- [ ] Technical decisions made with rationale
- [ ] Scope or priority changes with approval
- [ ] Architecture or design choices
- [ ] Process or workflow adjustments

### Next Session Plan
- [ ] Immediate next steps to take
- [ ] Files to review or reference
- [ ] Personas to engage first
- [ ] Outstanding questions or decisions needed

### Context Notes
- [ ] Important user preferences or constraints
- [ ] Domain-specific knowledge discovered
- [ ] External dependencies or integrations
- [ ] Quality standards or requirements noted

## Memory Optimization

### Essential Information
- [ ] Critical for project continuity
- [ ] Recent and relevant decisions
- [ ] Active work status and blockers
- [ ] User-specific preferences

### Condensed Format
- [ ] Bullet points over paragraphs
- [ ] Links to files rather than full content
- [ ] Key decisions with brief rationale
- [ ] Current state without full history

### Reference Links
- [ ] Point to detailed documentation
- [ ] Link to specific sections in large files
- [ ] Reference external resources
- [ ] Include file paths for easy access

## Deliverables
- Session state file using `session-state-tmpl.md`
- Core dump with essential context for next session
- File change log with rationale
- Next session preparation notes

## Quality Validation
- [ ] Contains essential information for continuity
- [ ] Concise enough for efficient loading
- [ ] References detailed docs rather than duplicating
- [ ] Clear action items for next session

## Handoff Process
Session end → Core dump creation for future session continuity
Project milestones → Enhanced documentation in planning journal
Major decisions → Update to relevant project documentation

## Notes
- Keep core dump concise but comprehensive
- Focus on actionable information for next session
- Link to detailed documentation rather than duplicating
- Update regularly during long sessions to capture progress
