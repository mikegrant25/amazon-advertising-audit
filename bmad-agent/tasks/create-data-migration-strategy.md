# Create Data Migration Strategy

**Persona**: Data Engineer  
**Phase**: Implementation/Migration  
**Prerequisites**: Source and target database schemas, data volume analysis, business continuity requirements

## Purpose
Design and implement a comprehensive strategy for migrating data between systems, schema versions, or platforms while ensuring data integrity, minimal downtime, and business continuity.

## Required Inputs
- **Source System Documentation**: Current database schema and data characteristics
- **Target System Design**: New database design from `create-database-design.md`
- **Business Requirements**: Downtime tolerance, rollback needs, compliance requirements
- **Data Volume Analysis**: Size, growth rate, and complexity of data

## Key Activities

### 1. Migration Assessment
**Analyze Current State**:
- Document source schema structure
- Identify data volumes and growth rates
- Map data types between systems
- Identify transformation requirements
- Assess data quality issues

**Define Target State**:
- Review target schema design
- Identify gaps and incompatibilities
- Plan data transformations
- Define success criteria
- Establish rollback triggers

### 2. Migration Strategy Selection

**Big Bang Migration**:
- **When**: Small data volumes, acceptable downtime window
- **Pros**: Simple, clean cutover
- **Cons**: Higher risk, requires downtime
- **Process**: Stop → Migrate → Validate → Start

**Phased Migration**:
- **When**: Large systems, minimal risk tolerance
- **Pros**: Lower risk, gradual validation
- **Cons**: Complex coordination, longer timeline
- **Process**: Migrate by module/feature/data type

**Parallel Run**:
- **When**: Zero downtime requirement, critical systems
- **Pros**: Safe rollback, live validation
- **Cons**: Complex sync, resource intensive
- **Process**: Dual writes → Sync → Validate → Cutover

**Blue-Green Migration**:
- **When**: Cloud environments, automated infrastructure
- **Pros**: Instant rollback, minimal downtime
- **Cons**: Double resources, complex setup
- **Process**: Build parallel → Sync → Switch → Teardown

### 3. Data Transformation Planning

**Schema Mappings**:
- Field-to-field mapping documentation
- Data type conversions
- Null handling strategies
- Default value assignments
- Constraint modifications

**Business Logic Transformations**:
- Calculated field migrations
- Denormalization requirements
- Aggregation pre-computations
- Reference data updates
- Enum/lookup value mappings

**Data Cleansing**:
- Duplicate detection and resolution
- Invalid data handling
- Missing data strategies
- Format standardization
- Referential integrity fixes

### 4. Migration Implementation Design

**ETL/ELT Pipeline**:
```
## Extract Phase
- Connection configuration
- Query optimization
- Batch size planning
- Progress tracking
- Error handling

## Transform Phase
- Transformation rules
- Validation logic
- Error quarantine
- Performance optimization
- Memory management

## Load Phase
- Bulk loading strategies
- Transaction boundaries
- Constraint handling
- Index management
- Verification procedures
```

**Performance Optimization**:
- Parallel processing design
- Batch size optimization
- Network bandwidth planning
- Database tuning for migration
- Resource allocation

### 5. Testing Strategy

**Test Phases**:
1. **Unit Testing**: Individual transformation rules
2. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end pipeline
3. **Performance Testing**: Full volume runs
4. **Validation Testing**: Data accuracy checks
5. **Rollback Testing**: Recovery procedures

**Validation Approaches**:
- Row count comparisons
- Checksum validations
- Statistical sampling
- Business rule verification
- Referential integrity checks

### 6. Execution Planning

**Pre-Migration Checklist**:
- [ ] Backups completed and verified
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Monitoring tools ready
- [ ] Support team briefed

**Migration Runbook**:
```
1. Pre-Migration Phase
   - Lock source data (if required)
   - Take final backups
   - Disable constraints/indexes
   
2. Migration Execution
   - Start migration pipeline
   - Monitor progress
   - Track error rates
   - Validate incrementally
   
3. Post-Migration Phase
   - Enable constraints/indexes
   - Run validation suite
   - Performance testing
   - Update statistics
   
4. Cutover Decision
   - Review validation results
   - Get stakeholder approval
   - Execute cutover
   - Monitor system health
```

### 7. Risk Management

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Data loss prevention strategies
- Corruption detection methods
- Performance degradation handling
- Rollback trigger criteria
- Communication protocols

**Contingency Planning**:
- Partial migration fallback
- Data reconciliation procedures
- Emergency rollback steps
- Business continuity plans
- Incident response procedures

### 8. Post-Migration Activities

**Validation & Monitoring**:
- Continuous data validation
- Performance benchmarking
- User acceptance testing
- System health monitoring
- Issue tracking and resolution

**Documentation & Handoff**:
- Migration report generation
- Lessons learned documentation
- Runbook updates
- Knowledge transfer sessions
- Support documentation

## Deliverables

### Migration Strategy Document
- Executive summary with approach rationale
- Detailed migration plan with timelines
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Resource requirements and responsibilities
- Success criteria and validation approach

### Technical Artifacts
- ETL/ELT pipeline code
- Transformation rule specifications
- Validation scripts and procedures
- Rollback procedures
- Performance tuning guidelines

### Operational Runbooks
- Step-by-step migration procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Troubleshooting guidelines
- Emergency response procedures
- Post-migration maintenance tasks

## Quality Gates

Before execution:
- [ ] All transformations tested with sample data
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested successfully
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off obtained
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

After execution:
- [ ] All data successfully migrated
- [ ] Validation tests passed
- [ ] Performance meets SLAs
- [ ] No data integrity issues
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Next Steps
After migration strategy is approved:
1. Coordinate with DevOps for infrastructure setup
2. Work with QA Engineer for test scenario development
3. Align with Developer for application compatibility
4. Schedule migration windows with stakeholders
5. Prepare production support team
