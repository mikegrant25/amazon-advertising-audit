# Task: Implement Story

**Persona**: Developer  
**Phase**: Implementation  
**Prerequisites**: Story with clear acceptance criteria, architecture design, UX specifications

## Objective
Transform a user story into working, tested code that meets all acceptance criteria and quality standards.

## Process

### 1. Story Analysis
- [ ] Read and understand the complete story document
- [ ] Identify all acceptance criteria and edge cases
- [ ] Review technical guidance and architecture alignment
- [ ] Clarify any ambiguous requirements with Product Manager

### 2. Implementation Planning
- [ ] Break story into implementable subtasks
- [ ] Identify required API endpoints or data changes
- [ ] Plan test coverage strategy
- [ ] Estimate implementation approach and potential risks

### 3. Test-First Development
- [ ] Write failing tests that validate acceptance criteria
- [ ] Write unit tests for core business logic
- [ ] Write integration tests for API changes
- [ ] Ensure tests clearly document expected behavior

### 4. Implementation
- [ ] Implement minimum code to pass tests
- [ ] Follow established code patterns and conventions
- [ ] Handle error cases gracefully
- [ ] Add appropriate logging for debugging

### 5. Quality Validation
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows security best practices
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable
- [ ] Documentation updated where needed

### 6. Story Completion
- [ ] Validate against all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Update story status to completed
- [ ] Document any technical decisions or trade-offs

## Deliverables
- Working code that implements all story requirements
- Comprehensive test suite covering happy path and edge cases
- Updated technical documentation if needed
- Validation that all acceptance criteria are met

## Quality Checks
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Error handling covers failure scenarios
- [ ] Code passes linting and formatting checks
- [ ] Integration with existing system verified

## Handoff
Implementation complete â†’ Orchestrator for documentation updates and deployment readiness validation

## Notes
- Prioritize clarity and maintainability over cleverness
- When requirements are unclear, clarify with Product Manager before proceeding
- Document any assumptions or technical debt introduced
