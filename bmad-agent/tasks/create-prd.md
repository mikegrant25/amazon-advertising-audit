# Task: Create Product Requirements Document

**Persona**: Product Manager  
**Phase**: Discovery → Requirements  
**Prerequisites**: Project brief, research findings, user insights

## Objective
Transform research and vision into clear, prioritized product requirements that guide technical design and implementation.

## Process

### 1. Review Foundation
- [ ] Review project brief and vision statement
- [ ] Analyze research findings from Analyst
- [ ] Understand user personas and their needs
- [ ] Clarify business goals and success metrics

### 2. Define Product Strategy
- [ ] Articulate the core problem being solved
- [ ] Define target users and their primary use cases
- [ ] Establish value proposition and differentiation
- [ ] Set measurable success criteria

### 3. Scope Definition
- [ ] Define MVP boundaries - what's in and what's out
- [ ] Prioritize features by user value and business impact
- [ ] Identify non-negotiable requirements vs nice-to-haves
- [ ] Plan feature release phases beyond MVP

### 4. Epic and Story Planning
- [ ] Break product vision into 3-5 major epics
- [ ] Define user stories within each epic
- [ ] Sequence stories by dependencies and value delivery
- [ ] Write clear acceptance criteria for each story

### 5. Requirements Documentation
- [ ] Document functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Specify non-functional requirements (performance, security, accessibility)
- [ ] Define integration requirements with external systems
- [ ] Capture assumptions and constraints

### 6. Stakeholder Alignment
- [ ] Review requirements with key stakeholders
- [ ] Resolve conflicts and competing priorities
- [ ] Get explicit approval on scope and priorities
- [ ] Document any compromises or trade-offs made

## PRD Structure

### Executive Summary
- [ ] Product vision and strategic importance
- [ ] Target market and user segments
- [ ] Key success metrics and business impact

### Problem Definition
- [ ] Clear problem statement with evidence
- [ ] Current solution gaps and pain points
- [ ] Opportunity size and market validation

### Solution Overview
- [ ] High-level solution approach
- [ ] Core value propositions for each user type
- [ ] Key differentiators from alternatives

### User Requirements
- [ ] Primary user personas with needs and goals
- [ ] User journey maps for key workflows
- [ ] Priority use cases and scenarios

### Feature Requirements
- [ ] Epic breakdown with business justification
- [ ] User stories with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Feature prioritization with rationale
- [ ] Dependencies and sequencing

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance expectations (response time, throughput)
- [ ] Security and compliance requirements
- [ ] Accessibility and usability standards
- [ ] Scalability and reliability targets

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- [ ] User adoption and engagement metrics
- [ ] Business impact measurements
- [ ] Quality and operational metrics

## Quality Validation

### Completeness Check
- [ ] All major user needs addressed
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Technical constraints documented
- [ ] Legal and compliance requirements captured

### Clarity Review
- [ ] Requirements are unambiguous
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Dependencies are explicit
- [ ] Assumptions are documented

### Feasibility Assessment
- [ ] Technical complexity is reasonable
- [ ] Timeline expectations are realistic
- [ ] Resource requirements are understood
- [ ] Risk factors are identified

## Deliverables
- Complete PRD using `prd-tmpl.md` template
- Prioritized backlog with story sequencing
- Success metrics and measurement plan
- Stakeholder sign-off on scope and priorities
- Clear handoff brief for Architect and Designer

## Handoff Process
PRD → Architect for technical feasibility and system design
User stories → Designer for UX planning and validation
Success metrics → Orchestrator for tracking setup
Scope agreements → All personas for implementation planning

## Notes
- Focus on the "what" and "why" - leave the "how" to technical personas
- Be ruthless about MVP scope - say no to preserve focus
- Ensure every feature has clear user value justification
- Document trade-offs and decisions for future reference
