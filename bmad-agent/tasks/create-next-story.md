# Task: Create Next User Story

**Persona**: Product Manager  
**Phase**: Planning  
**Prerequisites**: PRD with prioritized backlog, epic definitions, completed previous stories

## Objective
Identify and create the next logical user story that delivers maximum value while following proper dependencies and sequencing.

## Process

### 1. Story Identification
- [ ] Review project backlog and epic priorities
- [ ] Check status of current/previous stories
- [ ] Identify next story based on dependencies and value delivery
- [ ] Validate story fits within current epic scope

### 2. Story Definition
- [ ] Write clear user story in "As a... I want... So that..." format
- [ ] Define the specific user value and business benefit
- [ ] Ensure story is appropriately sized for one iteration
- [ ] Verify story is testable and has clear completion criteria

### 3. Context Development
- [ ] Provide background on why this story is needed now
- [ ] Explain how it fits within the larger epic and product vision
- [ ] Document dependencies on other stories or external factors
- [ ] Note any assumptions or constraints

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Creation
- [ ] Write specific, measurable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Cover happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios
- [ ] Include performance and quality requirements
- [ ] Ensure criteria are testable by development team

### 5. Technical Guidance
- [ ] Reference relevant architecture decisions and patterns
- [ ] Identify affected system components
- [ ] Suggest implementation approach without prescribing details
- [ ] Note any technical risks or considerations

### 6. Design Requirements
- [ ] Define user experience requirements
- [ ] Reference design system components to use
- [ ] Specify accessibility and usability requirements
- [ ] Include mockups or wireframes if needed

## Story Quality Standards

### Value-Focused
- [ ] Delivers clear user or business value
- [ ] Can be demonstrated to stakeholders
- [ ] Moves product closer to strategic goals
- [ ] Justifies development effort required

### Well-Defined
- [ ] Clear, unambiguous language
- [ ] Specific acceptance criteria
- [ ] Appropriate scope and complexity
- [ ] Dependencies explicitly noted

### Implementation-Ready
- [ ] Technical guidance provided
- [ ] Sufficient detail for estimation
- [ ] Clear definition of done
- [ ] Testable requirements

### User-Centric
- [ ] Written from user perspective
- [ ] Solves real user problems
- [ ] Considers user workflows and context
- [ ] Includes usability requirements

## Story Structure

### Story Header
- [ ] Story ID and title
- [ ] Epic association
- [ ] Priority and effort estimate
- [ ] Status tracking

### Core Story
- [ ] User story statement
- [ ] Context and rationale
- [ ] User value explanation
- [ ] Dependencies and prerequisites

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Functional requirements in Given/When/Then format
- [ ] Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- [ ] Edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Integration requirements

### Implementation Guidance
- [ ] Architecture alignment notes
- [ ] Affected components and systems
- [ ] Technical approach suggestions
- [ ] Risk factors and considerations

### Design Specifications
- [ ] User experience requirements
- [ ] Interface design guidance
- [ ] Accessibility standards
- [ ] Mobile/responsive considerations

## Deliverables
- Complete user story using `story-tmpl.md` template
- Clear acceptance criteria that enable testing
- Technical guidance for implementation team
- Dependencies and sequencing documentation

## Quality Validation
- [ ] Story provides clear user value
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Technical guidance is helpful but not prescriptive
- [ ] Story fits within epic and sprint capacity
- [ ] Dependencies are resolved or explicitly managed

## Handoff Process
Story creation → Designer for UX validation and design specs
Story creation → Developer for estimation and technical review
Story validation → Orchestrator for backlog management and tracking

## Notes
- Focus on user outcomes, not technical tasks
- Keep stories independently deliverable when possible
- Balance detail with implementation flexibility
- Ensure clear definition of done for quality gates
