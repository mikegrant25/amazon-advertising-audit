# Task: Create API Specification

**Persona**: Architect  
**Phase**: Design  
**Prerequisites**: System architecture, data model, integration requirements

## Objective
Design clear, consistent API contracts that support frontend needs and enable future integrations.

## Process

### 1. API Strategy Definition
- [ ] Determine API style (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, hybrid)
- [ ] Define authentication and authorization approach
- [ ] Establish versioning strategy
- [ ] Plan rate limiting and usage policies

### 2. Endpoint Design
- [ ] Map user stories to API operations
- [ ] Design resource-oriented URLs (for REST)
- [ ] Define request/response schemas
- [ ] Plan error response formats

### 3. Data Contract Definition
- [ ] Specify input validation rules
- [ ] Define output data formats
- [ ] Document required vs optional fields
- [ ] Plan for pagination and filtering

### 4. Security Specification
- [ ] Define authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Specify authorization rules per endpoint
- [ ] Plan input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Document sensitive data handling

### 5. Documentation Creation
- [ ] Create OpenAPI/GraphQL schema
- [ ] Write clear endpoint descriptions
- [ ] Provide request/response examples
- [ ] Document error codes and messages

### 6. Integration Planning
- [ ] Consider frontend consumption patterns
- [ ] Plan for mobile and web client needs
- [ ] Document webhook specifications (if applicable)
- [ ] Design for third-party integrations

## API Design Principles

### Consistency
- [ ] Uniform naming conventions
- [ ] Consistent response formats
- [ ] Standard error handling patterns
- [ ] Predictable behavior across endpoints

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Self-documenting URLs and fields
- [ ] Helpful error messages
- [ ] Logical resource relationships
- [ ] Easy-to-test endpoints

### Performance
- [ ] Efficient data queries
- [ ] Appropriate caching headers
- [ ] Bulk operations where needed
- [ ] Pagination for large datasets

### Extensibility
- [ ] Forward-compatible schema design
- [ ] Versioning strategy for breaking changes
- [ ] Optional fields for future features
- [ ] Plugin or webhook architecture

## Deliverables
- Complete API specification (OpenAPI 3.0 or GraphQL schema)
- API design documentation with examples
- Authentication and authorization guide
- Integration guide for frontend developers
- Error handling and troubleshooting guide

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All user story requirements covered
- [ ] Frontend team can implement required features
- [ ] Security requirements addressed
- [ ] Performance requirements achievable
- [ ] API follows established conventions
- [ ] Third-party integration requirements met

## Handoff
API specification → Designer for frontend architecture alignment
API specification → Developer for implementation planning
Security model → All personas for compliance integration

## Notes
- Design APIs for the clients that will use them
- Prioritize consistency over convenience
- Plan for evolution and backward compatibility
- Consider rate limiting and abuse prevention from the start
