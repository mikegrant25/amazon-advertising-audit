# Create UI/UX Specification

## Purpose
Define comprehensive user interface and user experience specifications that guide frontend development and design implementation using the `front-end-spec-tmpl.md` template.

## Required Inputs
- **Project Brief**: `docs/project-brief.md`
- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: `docs/prd.md`
- **User research or feedback** (if available)

## Key Activities

### 1. Understand User Context
- Review project brief and PRD for user goals and constraints
- Identify target user personas and their needs
- Understand key user journeys and pain points

### 2. Define UX Foundation
Using the `front-end-spec-tmpl.md`, establish:

**User Experience Goals**:
- Define primary usability objectives
- Establish user experience principles
- Identify success metrics for user interactions

**Information Architecture**:
- Create site map or screen inventory
- Define navigation structure and hierarchy
- Plan content organization and labeling

### 3. Map User Flows
**Critical User Journeys**:
- Identify key user tasks from PRD
- Map step-by-step user flows with Mermaid diagrams
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Plan onboarding and empty states

**Interaction Design**:
- Define interaction patterns and behaviors
- Plan micro-interactions and feedback
- Establish loading and error state designs

### 4. Design System Foundation
**Visual Design System**:
- Define color palette and usage guidelines
- Establish typography hierarchy and scales
- Plan iconography and visual elements
- Define spacing and layout systems

**Component Library Planning**:
- Identify foundational UI components needed
- Define component states and variations
- Plan component composition patterns
- Establish design token structure

### 5. Responsive & Accessibility Strategy
**Responsive Design**:
- Define breakpoints and adaptation strategy
- Plan layout patterns for different screen sizes
- Consider mobile-first vs desktop-first approach

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- Define WCAG compliance level (2.1 AA recommended)
- Plan keyboard navigation patterns
- Consider screen reader and assistive technology support
- Define color contrast and visual accessibility requirements

### 6. Design Workflow Integration
**Design Tool Integration**:
- Link to primary design files (Figma, Sketch, etc.)
- Plan design handoff process
- Define design review and approval workflow

**Design Documentation**:
- Create style guide sections
- Document interaction specifications
- Plan design system maintenance

## Interactive Design Process

### Wireframing & Prototyping
If detailed designs don't exist yet:
1. **Low-fidelity wireframes**: Conceptualize key screen layouts
2. **User flow prototypes**: Create clickable flows for testing
3. **High-fidelity mockups**: Detailed visual designs

### Design Validation
- **User testing planning**: Define how designs will be validated
- **Stakeholder review process**: Establish approval workflow
- **Design iteration planning**: Plan for design refinement cycles

## Deliverables
- **UI/UX Specification Document**: `docs/ux-ui-spec.md`
- **Design system foundation**: Color, typography, component specifications
- **User flow documentation**: Key user journeys with interaction details
- **Accessibility guidelines**: Specific requirements and testing criteria

## Quality Gate
Ensure the specification covers:
- [ ] Clear user personas and goals
- [ ] Complete information architecture
- [ ] Detailed user flows for key features
- [ ] Design system foundation
- [ ] Responsive design strategy
- [ ] Accessibility requirements
- [ ] Integration with development workflow

## Next Steps
After UI/UX specification is complete:
1. Create frontend architecture that implements the design (`create-frontend-architecture.md`)
2. Generate detailed implementation stories
3. Begin component development and design system implementation
4. Plan user testing and design validation
