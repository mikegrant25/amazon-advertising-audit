# Task: Create Deployment Pipeline

**Persona**: DevOps Engineer  
**Phase**: Infrastructure/Deployment  
**Prerequisites**: Code repository, target deployment environment, quality gates defined

## Objective
Set up automated CI/CD pipeline that safely and reliably deploys code from development to production.

## Process

### 1. Pipeline Strategy
- [ ] Define deployment environments (dev, staging, production)
- [ ] Establish branching strategy and deployment triggers
- [ ] Plan rollback and recovery procedures
- [ ] Define quality gates and approval processes

### 2. Build Automation
- [ ] Set up automated builds on code changes
- [ ] Configure build artifact creation and storage
- [ ] Implement dependency management and caching
- [ ] Add build notifications and reporting

### 3. Testing Integration
- [ ] Run unit tests automatically on every commit
- [ ] Execute integration tests in staging environment
- [ ] Include security scanning in pipeline
- [ ] Add performance testing for critical paths

### 4. Deployment Automation
- [ ] Configure automated deployment to staging
- [ ] Set up production deployment with approvals
- [ ] Implement blue-green or rolling deployment strategy
- [ ] Add health checks and automated rollback

### 5. Infrastructure as Code
- [ ] Define infrastructure in code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- [ ] Version control infrastructure configurations
- [ ] Automate environment provisioning
- [ ] Include infrastructure testing and validation

### 6. Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Set up deployment success/failure tracking
- [ ] Configure application health monitoring
- [ ] Add performance and error rate monitoring
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and alerting

## Pipeline Stages

### Source Control Integration
- [ ] Webhook triggers on code commits
- [ ] Branch protection rules
- [ ] Code review requirements
- [ ] Automated security scanning

### Build and Test
- [ ] Dependency installation and caching
- [ ] Code compilation and packaging
- [ ] Automated test execution
- [ ] Code quality and coverage reporting

### Security and Compliance
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- [ ] Static code analysis for security issues
- [ ] Container image scanning (if applicable)
- [ ] Compliance validation checks

### Deployment Stages
- [ ] Automated deployment to development environment
- [ ] Integration testing in staging environment
- [ ] Manual approval gate for production
- [ ] Production deployment with monitoring

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Health check validation
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Automated rollback on failure

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets threshold
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Code review approved

### Performance
- [ ] Build time under acceptable threshold
- [ ] Application startup time validated
- [ ] Response time regression testing
- [ ] Resource usage within limits

### Security
- [ ] No high-severity vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] Secrets properly managed
- [ ] Compliance requirements met

## Deliverables
- Complete CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Infrastructure as Code templates
- Deployment runbooks and procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Rollback and recovery procedures
- Pipeline documentation and troubleshooting guide

## Best Practices
- [ ] Fail fast with clear error messages
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging
- [ ] Use immutable deployment artifacts
- [ ] Test the deployment process regularly
- [ ] Minimize manual intervention
- [ ] Secure secrets and credentials management

## Handoff
Pipeline setup → Orchestrator for documentation and team training
Monitoring setup → All personas for observability integration
Deployment procedures → Operations team (if separate)

## Notes
- Start simple and add complexity incrementally
- Prioritize reliability over speed
- Make rollbacks as easy as deployments
- Document common issues and their solutions
