# Architecture Design: [Project Name]

## Architecture Overview
[High-level description of the system architecture and key design decisions]

## Architecture Pattern Selection

Select the pattern that best matches your needs:

### 1. Modular Monolith with Vertical Slices
Single deployable unit with clear module boundaries, organized by features rather than layers.
- *Example: SaaS app where features need to be developed/removed quickly*
- *Example: Enterprise app with complex business logic but single deployment target*
- *Example: Startup MVP that may evolve to microservices later*

### 2. Distributed Services with Domain Boundaries
Multiple deployable services organized around business domains, communicating via APIs/events.
- *Example: E-commerce platform with separate inventory, ordering, and fulfillment systems*
- *Example: Financial platform where regulatory requirements mandate service isolation*
- *Example: Multi-team organization where teams own specific business capabilities*

### 3. Serverless/Function-First Architecture
Event-driven functions with managed infrastructure, minimal operational overhead.
- *Example: Data processing pipeline with variable/sporadic load*
- *Example: API that needs global distribution with minimal latency*
- *Example: Startup prioritizing development speed over infrastructure control*

### 4. Event-Driven Microservices
Loosely coupled services communicating primarily through events/messages.
- *Example: Real-time analytics platform processing multiple data streams*
- *Example: IoT platform handling millions of device events*
- *Example: System requiring complex workflows with multiple approval stages*

### 5. Edge-Optimized Architecture
Core services with edge computing for latency-sensitive operations.
- *Example: Gaming platform requiring <50ms response times globally*
- *Example: Content delivery system with personalization at edge*
- *Example: Industrial IoT with local processing requirements*

### 6. Traditional N-Tier Architecture
Layered architecture with presentation, business logic, and data layers.
- *Example: Internal enterprise CRUD application*
- *Example: Simple web application with well-understood requirements*
- *Example: Team familiar with specific framework conventions (Rails, Django)*

### 7. Custom/Hybrid Architecture Approach
None of these patterns exactly fit. Let's design a hybrid approach based on your specific needs...

**Selected Pattern**: [Document your choice and rationale]

## System Components

### Component Architecture
```
[Visual representation or structured list of main components and their relationships]
```

### Component Inventory
#### [Component/Module/Service Name]

- **Interface**: [How others interact with it - API, events, direct calls]
- **Deployment**: [How it's deployed - container, function, embedded, etc.]
- **Data Ownership**: [What data this component owns/manages]

[Repeat for each major component]

## Data Architecture

- *Example: Social platform with graph DB for relationships, document DB for posts*
- *Example: Gaming platform with leaderboards in Redis, player data in DynamoDB*

### 3. Event Sourcing with CQRS
Store all changes as events, separate read and write models.
- *Example: Banking system needing complete audit trail*
- *Example: Collaborative editing with conflict resolution*
- *Example: Systems where understanding "how we got here" is critical*

### 4. Data Lake/Warehouse Architecture  
Centralized repository for structured and unstructured data at scale.
- *Example: Analytics platform aggregating multiple data sources*
- *Example: ML system needing historical data for training*
- *Example: Enterprise reporting across multiple systems*

### 5. Distributed SQL
Globally distributed relational database with horizontal scaling.
- *Example: Global SaaS needing low latency worldwide*
- *Example: Multi-region app requiring strong consistency*
- *Example: High-traffic app outgrowing single database*

### 6. Edge-Cached Database
Primary database with aggressive edge caching strategy.
- *Example: Content platform with Cloudflare KV for hot data*
- *Example: E-commerce with edge-cached product catalogs*
- *Example: Apps with high read-to-write ratios*
