# Test Strategy: [Project Name]

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Quality Built-In**: Testing is integrated throughout development, not added at the end
- **Fast Feedback**: Tests provide rapid feedback during development
- **Reliable Results**: Tests are deterministic and trusted by the team
- **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications

### Quality Goals
- **Reliability**: [Target uptime/failure rate, e.g., 99.9% uptime]
- **Performance**: [Response time targets, e.g., <200ms for API calls]
- **Security**: [Security standards compliance, e.g., OWASP Top 10 protection]
- **Accessibility**: [Accessibility compliance, e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA]

## Test Level Strategy

### Unit Testing
**Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and small modules in isolation
- **Tools**: [Testing framework, e.g., Jest, PyTest, JUnit]
- **Location**: [File location pattern, e.g., `*.test.ts` co-located with source]
- **Coverage Target**: [Target percentage and rationale, e.g., 80% line coverage for business logic]

**Approach**:
- Test all public methods and significant logic paths
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, file system, time)
- Focus on business logic, algorithms, and edge cases
- Test error conditions and boundary values

**Mocking Strategy**:
- **Mock Library**: [Chosen mocking framework, e.g., Jest mocks, unittest.mock]
- **External Dependencies**: All network calls, databases, file system operations
- **Time/Dates**: Use deterministic time for consistent test results

### Integration Testing
**Scope**: Component interactions within application boundaries
- **Tools**: [Integration testing tools, e.g., Testcontainers, supertest]
- **Location**: [Directory structure, e.g., `/tests/integration`]
- **Environment**: [Test environment approach, e.g., containerized dependencies]

**Test Categories**:
- **API Endpoints**: Request/response validation with database interactions
- **Service Integration**: Multi-service workflows and data consistency
- **Database Operations**: Data access patterns and transaction handling
- **External Service Integration**: Third-party API interactions (with test doubles)

### End-to-End Testing
**Scope**: Complete user workflows from frontend through backend
- **Tools**: [E2E testing framework, e.g., Playwright, Cypress, REST Assured]
- **Environment**: [Testing environment, e.g., staging environment, docker-compose]

**Critical User Journeys**:
1. **[Primary User Flow]**: [Description of main user workflow]
2. **[Authentication Flow]**: [User registration, login, logout scenarios]
3. **[Core Feature Flow]**: [Primary feature usage from PRD]
4. **[Error Recovery Flow]**: [How users recover from common errors]

**Error Scenarios**:
- Authentication failures and session expiration
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid input handling
- System capacity limits

## Specialized Testing

### Performance Testing
**Tools**: [Performance testing tools, e.g., k6, JMeter, Artillery]

**Test Types**:
- **Load Testing**: Normal expected traffic patterns
- **Stress Testing**: Peak capacity and breaking points
- **Spike Testing**: Sudden traffic increases
- **Endurance Testing**: Sustained load over time

**Performance Targets**:
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| API Response Time | [<200ms] | [95th percentile] |
| Page Load Time | [<2 seconds] | [Time to interactive] |
| Concurrent Users | [1000] | [Without degradation] |
| Database Queries | [<50ms] | [Average response time] |

### Security Testing
**Approach**: [Security testing methodology, e.g., OWASP Testing Guide]

**Test Areas**:
- **Authentication**: Login security, session management, password policies
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control, privilege escalation prevention
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection prevention
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, authentication, input sanitization
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, PII handling

### Accessibility Testing
**Compliance Target**: [WCAG 2.1 AA compliance]

**Testing Approach**:
- **Automated Scanning**: [Tools like axe-core, Lighthouse]
- **Manual Testing**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **User Testing**: Testing with users who have disabilities

## Testing Environments

### Local Development
**Setup Requirements**:
- [Local testing database setup, e.g., Docker PostgreSQL]
- [Mock external services configuration]
- [Test data seeding approach]

### Continuous Integration
**CI Pipeline Testing**:
- **Trigger**: Every pull request and merge to main branch
- **Test Suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, security scans
- **Quality Gates**: [Coverage thresholds, performance benchmarks]
- **Failure Handling**: [Notification approach, auto-rollback triggers]

### Staging Environment
**Purpose**: Integration testing and user acceptance testing
- **Data**: [Production-like test data, anonymized if needed]
- **Configuration**: [Production-similar environment setup]
- **Access**: [Who can deploy and test in staging]

## Quality Assurance Process

### Development Workflow
**Test-Driven Development**:
- Write failing tests before implementation
- Implement minimum code to pass tests
- Refactor while maintaining test coverage

**Code Review Requirements**:
- [ ] All new code includes appropriate tests
- [ ] Tests cover happy path and error scenarios
- [ ] Mock usage is appropriate and minimal
- [ ] Test names clearly describe behavior being tested

### Definition of Done
A story is complete when:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria have corresponding tests
- [ ] Unit tests pass with required coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate component interactions
- [ ] Security requirements are tested and validated
- [ ] Performance requirements are met and tested
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are tested (if UI changes)

### Release Process
**Pre-Release Testing**:
1. **Regression Test Suite**: Full automated test suite execution
2. **Performance Validation**: Load testing against performance targets
3. **Security Scan**: Automated security vulnerability assessment
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Key user journey validation

**Production Deployment**:
- **Smoke Tests**: Critical path validation after deployment
- **Monitoring**: Error rate and performance monitoring
- **Rollback Criteria**: Automatic rollback triggers and manual override
