# API Design Quality Checklist

## API Design Fundamentals

### 1. Requirements Alignment
- [ ] API design supports all identified user stories and use cases
- [ ] Functional requirements from PRD are fully addressed
- [ ] Non-functional requirements (performance, security) are met
- [ ] Integration requirements with external systems are satisfied
- [ ] API versioning strategy accommodates future requirements

### 2. Resource Design (for REST APIs)
- [ ] Resources are properly identified and named using nouns
- [ ] Resource hierarchies and relationships are logical and consistent
- [ ] URL structure follows RESTful conventions and patterns
- [ ] HTTP methods are used appropriately (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- [ ] Resource identifiers are consistent and meaningful

### 3. Data Model Consistency
- [ ] Request and response schemas are well-defined and consistent
- [ ] Data types and formats are appropriate and validated
- [ ] Required vs optional fields are clearly specified
- [ ] Field naming follows consistent conventions
- [ ] Data relationships and constraints are properly modeled

## API Usability and Developer Experience

### 4. Documentation Quality
- [ ] API endpoints are clearly documented with descriptions
- [ ] Request and response examples are provided for all endpoints
- [ ] Error responses and status codes are documented
- [ ] Authentication and authorization requirements are clear
- [ ] Rate limiting and usage guidelines are specified

### 5. Intuitive Design
- [ ] API structure is logical and predictable for developers
- [ ] Endpoint names and parameters are self-explanatory
- [ ] Common use cases can be accomplished with minimal API calls
- [ ] API follows principle of least surprise
- [ ] Consistent patterns used across all endpoints

### 6. Error Handling
- [ ] Error responses follow consistent format and structure
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable for developers
- [ ] HTTP status codes are used correctly and consistently
- [ ] Error codes are documented with resolution guidance
- [ ] Validation errors provide specific field-level feedback

## Security and Access Control

### 7. Authentication Design
- [ ] Authentication mechanism is appropriate for use case (JWT, OAuth, API keys)
- [ ] Authentication flow is clearly documented and testable
- [ ] Token refresh and expiration handling is specified
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication supported where required
- [ ] Authentication failures provide appropriate feedback

### 8. Authorization and Permissions
- [ ] Authorization model aligns with business requirements
- [ ] Permission levels and scopes are clearly defined
- [ ] Resource access controls are consistently applied
- [ ] Admin vs user access patterns are appropriate
- [ ] Cross-tenant data access is properly restricted

### 9. Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly protected in transit and at rest
- [ ] PII and confidential data handling follows privacy requirements
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Output encoding prevents data exposure
- [ ] Audit logging captures security-relevant events

## Performance and Scalability

### 10. Performance Design
- [ ] API response times meet performance requirements
- [ ] Database query patterns are optimized
- [ ] Caching strategies are appropriate and documented
- [ ] Pagination is implemented for large data sets
- [ ] Bulk operations are available where appropriate

### 11. Rate Limiting and Throttling
- [ ] Rate limiting strategy protects against abuse
- [ ] Throttling rules are appropriate for different user types
- [ ] Rate limit headers inform clients of current status
- [ ] Rate limit documentation includes retry strategies
- [ ] Graceful degradation under high load is planned

### 12. Scalability Considerations
- [ ] API design supports horizontal scaling
- [ ] Database design can handle expected load
- [ ] Caching strategy reduces database load
- [ ] Asynchronous processing used for long-running operations
- [ ] External service dependencies are properly managed

## Integration and Compatibility

### 13. External Service Integration
- [ ] Third-party API integrations are properly abstracted
- [ ] External service failures are handled gracefully
- [ ] Timeout and retry logic is implemented
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns used where appropriate
- [ ] Service level agreements (SLAs) are considered

### 14. Backward Compatibility
- [ ] API versioning strategy prevents breaking changes
- [ ] Deprecation timeline and process is defined
- [ ] New fields are optional to maintain compatibility
- [ ] Legacy endpoint support timeline is specified
- [ ] Migration guide provided for version changes

### 15. Frontend Integration
- [ ] API design supports efficient frontend data loading
- [ ] Response formats are optimized for client consumption
- [ ] Real-time features (WebSockets, SSE) are appropriately designed
- [ ] Mobile client considerations are addressed
- [ ] Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is properly configured

## Testing and Validation

### 16. API Testing Strategy
- [ ] API endpoints are designed to be easily testable
- [ ] Test data requirements and setup are defined
- [ ] Contract testing approach is specified
- [ ] Integration testing strategy covers all endpoints
- [ ] Performance testing approach is documented

### 17. Validation and Monitoring
- [ ] Input validation rules are comprehensive and documented
- [ ] API monitoring and observability requirements are defined
- [ ] Health check endpoints are included
- [ ] Logging strategy captures necessary debugging information
- [ ] Metrics collection supports performance monitoring

## Deployment and Operations

### 18. Deployment Considerations
- [ ] API deployment strategy is defined and tested
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration is externalized
- [ ] Database migration strategy supports API changes
- [ ] Blue-green or rolling deployment approach is specified
- [ ] Rollback procedures are defined and tested

### 19. Operational Excellence
- [ ] API monitoring and alerting strategy is defined
- [ ] Incident response procedures are documented
- [ ] Capacity planning considers expected growth
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures are specified
- [ ] API documentation is kept up-to-date with changes

## Final Review

### 20. Comprehensive Validation
- [ ] All checklist items have been reviewed and validated
- [ ] API design has been reviewed by appropriate stakeholders
- [ ] Implementation team confirms API is implementable
- [ ] Frontend team confirms API meets their needs
- [ ] Security review completed and approved

### 21. Documentation Completeness
- [ ] OpenAPI/GraphQL schema is complete and valid
- [ ] Integration guide provides clear implementation guidance
- [ ] Authentication and authorization guide is comprehensive
- [ ] Error handling guide covers all scenarios
