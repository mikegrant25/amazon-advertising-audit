# Security Threat Model Quality Checklist

## Threat Identification Completeness

### 1. Asset Inventory
- [ ] All sensitive data types identified and categorized
- [ ] Critical system components and services documented
- [ ] External interfaces and integration points mapped
- [ ] User access patterns and privilege levels defined
- [ ] Third-party dependencies and their risks assessed

### 2. STRIDE Threat Analysis
- [ ] **Spoofing**: Identity verification vulnerabilities identified
- [ ] **Tampering**: Data integrity threats analyzed
- [ ] **Repudiation**: Non-repudiation gaps documented
- [ ] **Information Disclosure**: Data exposure risks assessed
- [ ] **Denial of Service**: Availability threats evaluated
- [ ] **Elevation of Privilege**: Authorization bypass risks identified

### 3. Attack Vector Analysis
- [ ] External network attack vectors mapped
- [ ] Internal threat scenarios considered
- [ ] Social engineering vulnerabilities assessed
- [ ] Physical security considerations addressed
- [ ] Supply chain and dependency risks evaluated

## Risk Assessment Quality

### 4. Threat Prioritization
- [ ] Likelihood ratings based on realistic threat scenarios
- [ ] Impact assessments consider business and technical consequences
- [ ] Risk matrix combines likelihood and impact appropriately
- [ ] High-risk threats clearly identified and prioritized
- [ ] Risk tolerance levels aligned with business requirements

### 5. Vulnerability Assessment
- [ ] Known vulnerability patterns addressed (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] Platform and framework specific vulnerabilities considered
- [ ] Configuration and deployment vulnerabilities identified
- [ ] Human factor vulnerabilities (training, procedures) assessed
- [ ] Emerging threat patterns and trends considered

### 6. Compliance Requirements
- [ ] Regulatory requirements identified and mapped (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, etc.)
- [ ] Industry standards compliance verified (ISO 27001, SOC 2, etc.)
- [ ] Data residency and sovereignty requirements addressed
- [ ] Audit and reporting requirements documented
- [ ] Legal and contractual security obligations met

## Mitigation Strategy Effectiveness

### 7. Preventive Controls
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms appropriate for identified threats
- [ ] Authorization controls match privilege requirements
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection and malicious input
- [ ] Network security controls limit attack surface
- [ ] Encryption protects data at rest and in transit

### 8. Detective Controls
- [ ] Logging captures security-relevant events
- [ ] Monitoring detects anomalous behavior patterns
- [ ] Intrusion detection systems appropriately configured
- [ ] Security metrics and KPIs defined
- [ ] Alerting mechanisms provide timely threat notification

### 9. Responsive Controls
- [ ] Incident response procedures defined and tested
- [ ] Escalation procedures appropriate for threat severity
- [ ] Recovery procedures restore service after security incidents
- [ ] Communication plans address stakeholder notification
- [ ] Post-incident analysis procedures capture lessons learned

## Implementation Feasibility

### 10. Technical Implementation
- [ ] Security controls are technically feasible with chosen architecture
- [ ] Performance impact of security measures is acceptable
- [ ] Security controls integrate well with development workflow
- [ ] Automated security testing can validate controls
- [ ] Security monitoring integrates with operational systems

### 11. Operational Considerations
- [ ] Security procedures can be executed by operations team
- [ ] Security training requirements identified for team members
- [ ] Security maintenance procedures defined and schedulable
- [ ] Cost of security measures is within budget constraints
- [ ] Security controls don't significantly impact user experience

### 12. Development Integration
