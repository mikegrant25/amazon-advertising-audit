# Amazon Advertising Audit Automation - Project Brief

## Executive Summary
Build an automated Amazon Advertising audit tool that transforms hours of manual analysis into minutes of intelligent insights, with unique focus on the paid-organic flywheel effect that competitors miss.

## Problem Statement
Amazon advertising agencies and consultants waste 3-5 hours of senior strategist time per audit, often missing critical optimization opportunities due to repetitive analysis patterns. The manual process produces inconsistent documentation and fails to analyze the crucial relationship between paid campaigns and organic ranking improvements.

## Solution Overview
An automated audit platform that:
- Processes Amazon Advertising export data (CSV/Excel)
- **Customizes analysis based on user's goal** (Revenue, Efficiency, New Customers, TACoS)
- Identifies optimization opportunities humans routinely miss
- Analyzes paid-organic flywheel effects using innovative metrics
- Generates goal-focused outputs: audit reports, implementation plans, and custom formats
- Saves agencies 80% of audit time while delivering targeted insights

## Key Differentiators
1. **Goal-Based Analysis**: Tailor insights to specific business objectives
2. **Paid-Organic Flywheel Analysis**: Track how paid campaigns improve organic rankings
3. **Ad-Attribution Ratio Innovation**: Use % of ad-attributed vs total revenue as organic proxy
4. **Pattern-Breaking Insights**: Surface opportunities that experienced strategists miss
5. **Multi-Output Generation**: Goal-focused audit doc + implementation plan + custom formats

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Amazon advertising agencies (10-50 person shops)
- **Secondary**: Independent consultants, enterprise in-house teams
- **User Persona**: Senior strategists doing client audits

## Technical Approach
- **Phase 1**: CSV/Excel upload and processing
- **Phase 2**: Third-party tool integration (Jungle Scout, Helium 10)
- **Phase 3**: Amazon Advertising API integration
- **Data Innovation**: Use existing metrics in new ways to infer organic performance

## Success Metrics
- Reduce audit time from 3-5 hours to 30 minutes
- Identify 20% more optimization opportunities than manual audits
- Generate consistent, professional outputs
- Enable agencies to audit 10x more accounts

## Constraints & Risks
- **Constraints**: No initial API access, limited organic data
- **Risks**: Data quality dependencies, agency adoption curve, competitive response
- **Mitigation**: Start simple with CSV, prove value, then expand
