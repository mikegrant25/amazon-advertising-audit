# User Story US-002-008: A/B Testing Framework

## Story
As an **agency user**, I want **built-in A/B testing capabilities** so that **I can validate strategies and optimize based on data rather than assumptions**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Test Setup**
   - Create A/B tests for strategies
   - Define test parameters and duration
   - Set success metrics
   - Randomize test allocation

2. **Test Management**
   - Monitor running tests
   - Pause/resume capabilities
   - Extend test duration
   - Early stopping rules

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Calculate statistical significance
   - Confidence intervals
   - Sample size recommendations
   - Power analysis

4. **Results Visualization**
   - Test performance dashboards
   - Comparative analysis
   - Trend visualization
   - Winner identification

5. **Test Documentation**
   - Test result archives
   - Learning documentation
   - Best practice library
   - Test templates

## Technical Notes
- Implement statistical testing engine
- Build test allocation system
- Create visualization framework
- Design template system
