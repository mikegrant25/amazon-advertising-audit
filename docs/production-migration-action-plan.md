# Production Migration Action Plan

## Current Status âœ…
- MVP migrations are ready and tested
- Production deployment is live at audit.verexiq.com
- Database is operational but needs migrations run

## Immediate Next Steps (Today)

### Step 1: Run MVP Migrations (5 minutes)
The migration SQL is already in your clipboard. If not, run:
```bash
cat "/Volumes/4TB External SSD/Amazon Advertising Audit/supabase/migrations/all_migrations_combined.sql" | pbcopy
```

1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uvqjuktvqnjtlhfxkybl/sql/new
2. Paste and click "Run"
3. Verify in Table Editor that all tables exist

### Step 2: Test Basic Functionality (10 minutes)
1. Visit https://audit.verexiq.com
2. Sign up/sign in
3. Create a test audit
4. Upload a sample CSV
5. Verify everything works

### Step 3: Run Production Bridge Migration (5 minutes)
This adds production features while maintaining backward compatibility:
```bash
cat "/Volumes/4TB External SSD/Amazon Advertising Audit/supabase/migrations/mvp_to_production_bridge.sql" | pbcopy
```

1. Go back to SQL Editor
2. Paste and run the bridge migration
3. This adds:
   - Organization support
   - Performance indexes
   - Analytics tables
   - Enhanced security

## Production Features Added

### 1. **Multi-Tenancy**
- Each user gets a default organization
- Ready for agencies to invite team members
- Role-based permissions (owner, admin, member)

### 2. **Performance Optimizations**
- Strategic indexes for common queries
- Pre-aggregated metrics table
- JSONB GIN indexes for fast searches

### 3. **Monitoring**
- Slow query tracking
- API usage analytics
- Ready for dashboards

### 4. **Future-Ready**
- Organization settings for white-labeling
- API key infrastructure (Phase 2)
- Scalable schema design

## What You Get Immediately

1. **No Breaking Changes**: Your app continues to work exactly as before
2. **Better Performance**: Queries will be faster with new indexes
3. **Organization Support**: Users automatically get personal organizations
4. **Analytics Ready**: Metrics tables for future dashboard features

## Next Development Phases

### Phase 1: Current MVP âœ…
- File upload and processing
- Basic analysis
- Single-user focused

### Phase 2: Team Features (Next Sprint)
- Invite team members
- Share audits within organization
- Role-based permissions UI

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
- Use pre-aggregated metrics
- Build performance dashboards
- Historical comparisons

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features
- API keys for integrations
- White-label customization
- Advanced quotas and limits

## Database Performance Tips

1. **After migrations, run**:
   ```sql
   ANALYZE;
   ```

2. **Monitor table sizes**:
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
   FROM pg_tables
   WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
   ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
   ```

3. **Check slow queries**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM analytics.slow_queries ORDER BY execution_time_ms DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

## Quick Wins After Migration

1. **Faster File Processing**: Indexed queries on audit_files
2. **Quicker Dashboard Loads**: Organization-scoped queries
3. **Better Search**: Full-text and JSONB indexes
4. **Audit Trail**: Ready for compliance requirements
