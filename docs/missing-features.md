# Missing Features & Known Issues

## Production Status: January 15, 2025

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issues

#### 1. Clerk JWT Template Configuration
**Status**: Not configured in production  
**Impact**: Users can log in but cannot upload files or access data  
**Solution**: Follow [Clerk JWT Configuration Guide](./clerk-jwt-configuration.md)  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must fix before pilot launch  

#### 2. Missing Report Types
**DSP Report Upload**  
- Status: Not implemented
- Impact: Cannot analyze DSP campaign data
- Required: New upload component and parsing logic

**Campaign Performance Report**  
- Status: Not implemented  
- Impact: Cannot analyze campaign-level performance
- Required: New upload component and parsing logic

#### 3. File Format Support
**Current**: Only CSV files supported  
**Missing**: Excel (.xlsx) file support  
**Impact**: Users must convert Excel files to CSV before upload  
**Solution**: Add xlsx parsing library (e.g., SheetJS)  

#### 4. Email Deliverability
**Issue**: Emails going to spam/junk folders  
**Cause**: Missing email authentication (SPF/DKIM)  
**Solution**: Configure domain email authentication  

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Priority

1. **Fix JWT Template** (1-2 hours)
   - Configure in Clerk Dashboard
   - Update Supabase settings
   - Test file upload flow

2. **Add Excel Support** (2-4 hours)
   - Install SheetJS library
   - Update file validation
   - Add conversion logic
   - Test with sample files

3. **Implement DSP Report** (4-6 hours)
   - Create upload component
   - Define data schema
   - Implement parsing logic
   - Add to analysis pipeline

4. **Implement Campaign Performance** (4-6 hours)
   - Create upload component
   - Define data schema
   - Implement parsing logic
   - Add to analysis pipeline

5. **Fix Email Deliverability** (2-3 hours)
   - Configure SPF records
   - Set up DKIM
   - Test email delivery

### ðŸ›  Technical Details

#### DSP Report Schema (Proposed)
```typescript
interface DSPReport {
  date: Date
  campaignId: string
  impressions: number
  clicks: number
  spend: number
  conversions: number
  viewability: number
  // Additional DSP-specific metrics
}
```

#### Campaign Performance Schema (Proposed)
```typescript
interface CampaignPerformanceReport {
  campaignId: string
  campaignName: string
  startDate: Date
  endDate: Date
  impressions: number
  clicks: number
  spend: number
  sales: number
  acos: number
  roas: number
}
```

#### Excel Support Implementation
```typescript
// Add to package.json
"dependencies": {
  "xlsx": "^0.18.5"
}

// Update file parser
import * as XLSX from 'xlsx'

function parseExcelFile(file: File): Promise<any[]> {
  const reader = new FileReader()
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reader.onload = (e) => {
      const data = e.target?.result
      const workbook = XLSX.read(data, { type: 'binary' })
      const sheetName = workbook.SheetNames[0]
      const worksheet = workbook.Sheets[sheetName]
      const jsonData = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet)
      resolve(jsonData)
    }
    reader.onerror = reject
    reader.readAsBinaryString(file)
  })
}
```

### ðŸ“Š Testing Requirements

Before marking features as complete:

1. **JWT Configuration**
   - [ ] User can upload files without permission errors
   - [ ] RLS policies correctly filter user data
   - [ ] Storage access works as expected

2. **New Report Types**
   - [ ] Sample files parse correctly
   - [ ] Data validates against schema
   - [ ] Analysis includes new metrics
   - [ ] PDF report shows new data

3. **Excel Support**
   - [ ] .xlsx files upload successfully
   - [ ] Data parses correctly
   - [ ] Large files handle gracefully
   - [ ] Error messages are clear

4. **Email Delivery**
   - [ ] Emails arrive in inbox (not spam)
   - [ ] SPF/DKIM passes validation
   - [ ] Email templates render correctly

### ðŸš€ Post-Fix Validation

Once all issues are resolved:

1. Complete end-to-end test with all report types
2. Verify production deployment
3. Update documentation
4. Begin pilot agency recruitment
5. Monitor for new issues

---

**Note**: Fix the JWT configuration first - it's blocking all other functionality. The other features can be implemented in parallel once basic functionality is restored.
