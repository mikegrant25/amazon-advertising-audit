## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Processing Performance**: Start optimization early, use efficient algorithms
2. **File Parsing Issues**: Build robust validation, clear error messages
3. **Real-time Updates**: Test Supabase subscriptions thoroughly
4. **Large Files**: Implement streaming where possible

### Schedule Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features, defer nice-to-haves
2. **Integration Issues**: Test service connections early
3. **Testing Delays**: QA involved from Sprint 1

## Success Criteria
