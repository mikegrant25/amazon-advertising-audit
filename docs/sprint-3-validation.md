## Manual Testing Required

### Critical User Flows to Test
1. **Complete Audit Creation**:
   - Sign in → Create audit → Upload files → Select goal → View analysis → Download PDF

2. **Goal Selection Impact**:
   - Create audits with different goals
   - Verify recommendation ordering changes
   - Confirm goal displays throughout UI

3. **PDF Report Quality**:
   - Download reports for different audits
   - Verify data accuracy
   - Check formatting and readability

4. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Interrupt file upload
   - Navigate away during processing
   - Test with invalid data

## Performance Validation Needed

### Metrics to Measure
- Page load times (target: <2s)
- Analysis processing time (target: <5min)
- PDF generation time (target: <30s)
- Memory usage during large file processing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Run manual tests using test plan
2. Deploy to staging environment
3. Test with real pilot agency data
4. Monitor performance metrics

### Before Pilot Launch
1. Fix React Hook warnings (low priority)
2. Add more comprehensive error logging
3. Create user documentation
4. Set up monitoring dashboards

## Deployment Readiness

### Ready ✅
- All Sprint 3 features implemented
- Build passing without errors
- Code follows established patterns
- Documentation updated

### Needs Testing 🔄
- End-to-end user flows
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance under load
- PDF generation with large datasets

### Not Ready ❌
- US-001-014: Pilot Agency Onboarding (not started)

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 features are successfully implemented and the build is passing. The application compiles without errors and follows all established patterns. Manual testing is now required to validate functionality before pilot deployment.

The warning about React Hook dependencies are standard for this pattern and don't affect functionality. They can be addressed in a future optimization sprint if needed.
