# Sprint 3 Validation Report

## Validation Date: January 14, 2025

## Summary
Sprint 3 has been tested and validated. After fixing several issues, the application now builds successfully and all Sprint 3 features are implemented and functional.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Database Type Errors ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: `pilot_feedback` and `pilot_analytics` tables were missing from TypeScript definitions
- **Impact**: Build failures in API routes
- **Fix**: Added complete type definitions for both tables in `database.types.ts`

### 2. ESLint Accessibility Errors ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Form labels not properly associated with input elements
- **Impact**: Accessibility violations and build warnings
- **Fix**: Added `htmlFor` and `id` attributes to feedback widget form elements

### 3. Missing gtag Type Definitions ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Google Analytics `window.gtag` not defined in TypeScript
- **Impact**: TypeScript compilation errors
- **Fix**: Created `types/gtag.d.ts` with proper type definitions

### 4. API Column Name Mismatches ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Feedback API used incorrect column names (feedback_text vs feedback)
- **Impact**: Runtime errors when submitting feedback
- **Fix**: Updated API to use correct column names matching database schema

### 5. React Hook Dependency Warnings ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Missing dependencies in useEffect and useCallback hooks
- **Impact**: ESLint warnings during build
- **Fix**: Properly configured all hook dependencies to prevent infinite loops while satisfying ESLint

## Build Status: ✅ PASSING
