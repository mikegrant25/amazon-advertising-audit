# Current BMAD Session State

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-11 (Database Schema Completed)
**Active Role**: Developer
**Current Phase**: Sprint 1 - Epic 1 Implementation
**Working On**: Ready for US-001-005 Basic Authentication

## Context Summary:
All planning documentation is complete. Development has begun with Sprint 1 of Epic 1 (Flywheel Validation). The project scaffolding is now complete with Next.js 14, TypeScript, all development tooling configured, and folder structure established.

## Key Implementation Details:
- 14 user stories for Epic 1 (aligned with lean validation approach)
- 3-sprint plan for Epic 1 MVP
- US-001-001 through US-001-014 properly numbered and sequenced
- Development environment guide created with modern tooling
- Complete test strategy with Storybook and security focus

## Sprint 1 Progress:
- [x] US-001-001: Project Scaffolding (COMPLETED)
- [x] US-001-002: Development Environment Setup (COMPLETED)
- [x] US-001-003: CI/CD Pipeline (COMPLETED)
- [x] US-001-004: Database Schema & Supabase Setup (COMPLETED)
- [ ] US-001-005: Basic Authentication
- [ ] US-001-006: File Upload Infrastructure

## Key Quality Documentation Created:
1. Test strategy document
2. Goal-based test scenarios
3. Performance testing plan
4. Security testing plan (XSS, injections, DDoS)
5. Enterprise security compliance guide
6. Security roadmap with ROI
7. SOC 2 shared responsibility explanation

## Completed Artifacts:
- [x] All project documentation
- [x] User stories (US-001 to US-007)
- [x] Development plan with sprints
- [x] Technical implementation tasks
- [x] Dev environment setup guide (enhanced with tooling)
- [x] Test strategy document (updated with Storybook)
- [x] Goal-based test scenarios
- [x] Performance testing approach
- [x] Security test cases
- [x] Enterprise compliance documentation
- [x] Frontend package updates with professional tooling
- [x] Storybook integration for component development
- [x] Code quality tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
- [x] Bundle analysis and performance monitoring
- [x] GitHub repository created and configured
- [x] CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions + Vercel)
- [x] Production deployment live

## Next Actions:
- Execute US-001-005: Basic Authentication
- Integrate Clerk authentication with Next.js
- Set up user synchronization with Supabase
- Create authentication middleware and hooks

## Session History:
- Discovery → Requirements → Architecture → Design → Goal Enhancement → Development Planning → QA/Security
- All planning personas have completed their contributions
- PRD updated with lean Epic structure based on PO feedback
- User stories realigned to match Epic 1 structure (US-001-001 through US-001-014)
- Development started: US-001-001 Project Scaffolding completed
- US-001-002 Development Environment Setup completed (Docker, .env.local, dependencies fixed)
- US-001-003 CI/CD Pipeline completed (GitHub Actions, Vercel deployment configured)
- US-001-004 Database Schema completed (Supabase migrations, RLS policies, storage buckets)

## Key Decisions Summary:
1. Tech Stack: Next.js 14 + Railway + Supabase + Clerk + Vercel + Inngest
2. Goal-Based Analysis: 5 goal types for customized audits
3. Security: Progressive approach, SOC 2 by month 6
4. MVP: 3 months, targeting agencies first
5. Unique Value: Paid-organic flywheel analysis

## Enterprise Security Insights:
- Vendor SOC 2 (Supabase, Clerk, Railway) doesn't eliminate need for own SOC 2
- Shared responsibility model applies - we're responsible for application security
- Security roadmap prioritizes investments by ROI and customer segments
- Phase 2 (months 4-6) targets SOC 2 Type I for mid-market deals
