- [x] CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions + Vercel)
- [x] Production deployment live

## Next Actions:
- Sprint 2 Complete! All core analysis features implemented
- CSV parsing, flywheel analysis, and performance metrics ready
- Starting Sprint 3: MVP completion phase
- Next: US-001-010: Goal-Based Configuration UI

## Session History:
- Discovery â†’ Requirements â†’ Architecture â†’ Design â†’ Goal Enhancement â†’ Development Planning â†’ QA/Security
- All planning personas have completed their contributions
- PRD updated with lean Epic structure based on PO feedback
- User stories realigned to match Epic 1 structure (US-001-001 through US-001-014)
- Development started: US-001-001 Project Scaffolding completed
- US-001-002 Development Environment Setup completed (Docker, .env.local, dependencies fixed)
- US-001-003 CI/CD Pipeline completed (GitHub Actions, Vercel deployment configured)
- US-001-004 Database Schema completed (Supabase migrations, RLS policies, storage buckets)
- US-001-005 Basic Authentication completed (Clerk integration, user sync, protected routes)
- US-001-006 File Upload Infrastructure completed (drag-drop upload, validation, progress tracking)
- US-001-007 CSV Parsing completed (Papa Parse, validation schemas, processing queue, enhanced UI)
- US-001-008 Flywheel Analysis completed (metrics calculator, trend analysis, recommendations, API)
- US-001-009 Performance Metrics completed (CTR/CVR/ACoS/ROAS calculator, aggregation, top/bottom performers)

## Key Decisions Summary:
1. Tech Stack: Next.js 14 + Railway + Supabase + Clerk + Vercel + Inngest
2. Goal-Based Analysis: 5 goal types for customized audits
3. Security: Progressive approach, SOC 2 by month 6
4. MVP: 3 months, targeting agencies first
5. Unique Value: Paid-organic flywheel analysis

## Enterprise Security Insights:
- Vendor SOC 2 (Supabase, Clerk, Railway) doesn't eliminate need for own SOC 2
- Shared responsibility model applies - we're responsible for application security
- Security roadmap prioritizes investments by ROI and customer segments
- Phase 2 (months 4-6) targets SOC 2 Type I for mid-market deals
