## 💡 MVP Philosophy

> "Better to launch with one killer feature (paid-organic flywheel) that nobody else has than ten features everyone already does."

The MVP focuses ruthlessly on:
1. Saving time (80% reduction)
2. Finding hidden insights (flywheel effect)
3. Professional outputs (PDF + Excel)

Everything else can wait.
