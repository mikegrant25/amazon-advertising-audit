## Executive Summary

The Amazon Advertising Audit Tool has been deployed to production at https://audit.verexiq.com. While the core workflow is functional, several critical issues need resolution:

### 🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention:

## Conclusion

The Amazon Advertising Audit Tool has been deployed to production at https://audit.verexiq.com but is experiencing critical issues that prevent full functionality. The authentication system works, but file uploads fail due to RLS permission issues. Additionally, two report types are missing entirely, and the system only supports CSV files.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize fixing the JWT template configuration and implementing missing features before onboarding pilot agencies. The current state would provide a poor first impression and unreliable data for pilot validation.
