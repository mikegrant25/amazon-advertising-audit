## Document Control
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Last Updated**: December 6, 2024
- **Status**: Active Development
- **Current Phase**: Epic 1 - MVP Core Functionality

## Executive Summary

The Amazon Advertising Audit Tool is a web-based application that automates the analysis of Amazon advertising campaigns, providing actionable insights and optimization recommendations. The tool addresses the critical need for rapid, accurate campaign audits that currently require hours of manual analysis by advertising specialists.

### MVP Focus (Epic 1)
The initial release focuses on delivering immediate value through automated campaign analysis with a fixed set of proven audit criteria, targeting agencies and consultants who need to quickly assess campaign performance for their clients.

### Long-term Vision
The platform will evolve into a comprehensive advertising optimization suite with customizable audit criteria, historical tracking, team collaboration, and advanced automation features.

5. **Knowledge Gaps**: Junior analysts may miss critical optimization opportunities

### Impact
- Agencies lose 15-20 hours per week on manual audits
