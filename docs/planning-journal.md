# Amazon Advertising Audit Automation - Planning Journal

## Project Vision
Automate Amazon Advertising performance audits to save agencies hours of senior strategist time while uncovering insights that manual audits miss, particularly the paid-organic flywheel effect.

## Key Discovery Insights

### Problem Validation
- **Time Waste**: Senior strategists spend multiple hours per manual audit
- **Pattern Blindness**: Repetitive analysis misses innovative optimization opportunities
- **Documentation Pain**: Manual Word/Excel creation is error-prone and inconsistent
- **Implementation Gap**: Auditors â‰  implementers, causing knowledge transfer issues

### Unique Value Proposition
**The Paid-Organic Flywheel Analysis** - No existing tool analyzes how paid campaigns drive organic ranking improvements, creating a compound effect that reduces long-term ad dependency.

### Technical Approach
- **MVP**: CSV/Excel upload processing
- **Future**: Amazon Advertising API integration
- **Organic Proxy**: Use ad-attributed revenue % as organic strength indicator
- **Enhancement Path**: Integrate with ranking tools (Jungle Scout, Helium 10)

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Amazon advertising agencies
- **Secondary**: Consultants, large brands with in-house teams
- **Agency Needs**: White-labelable outputs, time savings, differentiation

### Key Assumptions to Validate
1. Agencies will trust automated insights
2. Ad-attributed revenue % is sufficient proxy for organic performance
3. Agencies will share client data with the tool
4. The insights generated will be actionable enough to justify adoption

### Constraints
- No API access initially (CSV/Excel only)
- Limited organic data without third-party tools
- Must produce multiple output formats
- Cannot require manual data entry

### Open Questions
- Pricing model for agencies
- White-labeling requirements
- Integration needs with agency workflows
- Competitive audit tool landscape
