## Development Progress

### January 6, 2025 - US-001-002: Development Environment Setup

**Context**: After completing US-001-001 (project scaffolding), we encountered several dependency conflicts that needed resolution.

**Key Decisions Made**:

1. **Dependency Version Downgrades**
   - React: 19.0.0 → 18.3.1 (Storybook 7 doesn't support React 19)
   - Next.js: 15.3.3 → 14.2.5 (for React 18 compatibility)
   - Tailwind CSS: 4.0 → 3.4.0 (v4 syntax not widely supported)
   - ESLint: 9.0 → 8.57.0 (eslint-config-next compatibility)

2. **Configuration Changes**
   - Converted `next.config.ts` to `next.config.js` (Next.js 14 requirement)
   - Updated `tailwind.config.js` for v3 syntax
   - Modified `postcss.config.mjs` for v3 plugins
   - Updated `globals.css` from Tailwind v4 to v3 directives

3. **Development Environment**
   - Created `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL
   - Set up `.env.local` with placeholder values
   - Fixed Husky configuration for monorepo structure
   - Verified development server runs successfully

**Challenges Resolved**:
- npm dependency resolution errors
- Husky installation in subdirectory
- Next.js configuration file format
- Tailwind CSS version incompatibility

**Next Steps**:
- US-001-003: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- Configure GitHub Actions
- Set up Vercel and Railway deployments

### January 6, 2025 - US-001-001: Project Scaffolding

**Completed**:
- Initial Next.js 14 setup with TypeScript

### January 11, 2025 - US-001-003: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Completed**:
- GitHub Actions workflows for frontend CI
- Multi-job pipeline: lint, typecheck, test, build, e2e, storybook
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Automated preview deployments for PRs
- Environment variable documentation

**Key Files Created**:
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Comprehensive CI pipeline
2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Vercel deployment automation
3. `vercel.json` - Vercel project configuration
4. `docs/github-secrets-setup.md` - Secrets configuration guide

**CI/CD Features**:
- Parallel job execution for faster feedback
- Build artifact caching between jobs
- Coverage reporting with Codecov

### January 11, 2025 - CI/CD Deployment Complete

**Repository & Deployment**:
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/mikegrant25/amazon-advertising-audit
- Production URL: https://frontend-jmr3t6qov-mikes-projects-0e238c9d.vercel.app
- All GitHub secrets configured
- Vercel project linked and deployed
- CI/CD pipeline tested and working

**Configuration Steps Completed**:
1. Authenticated GitHub CLI with personal access token
2. Created public repository with `gh repo create`
3. Configured all required GitHub Actions secrets
4. Set up Vercel project with proper root directory
5. Fixed build configuration issues
6. Successfully deployed to production

**Lessons Learned**:
- Vercel needs root directory set to `frontend` for monorepo
- Build commands should not include `cd` when root directory is set
- GitHub CLI authentication works better with tokens than device flow

**Next Steps**:
- US-001-004: Database Schema & Supabase Setup

### January 11, 2025 - US-001-004: Database Schema & Supabase Setup

**Completed**:
- Designed comprehensive database schema for audit tool
- Created migration files with proper SQL structure
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Configured storage buckets for file uploads and reports
- Set up Supabase client configuration for Next.js
- Generated TypeScript types from database schema

**Key Design Decisions**:

1. **Database Schema**:
   - `users` table for Clerk authentication sync
   - `audits` table with JSONB for flexible analysis results
   - `audit_files` table with file deduplication support
   - Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
   - Updated_at triggers for all tables

2. **Security Implementation**:
   - RLS enabled on all tables
   - Policies tied to Clerk authentication (clerk_id)
   - Storage buckets with proper access controls
   - Service role access for backend processing

3. **Storage Configuration**:
   - `audit-files` bucket for user uploads (50MB limit)
   - `audit-reports` bucket for generated reports (100MB)
   - MIME type restrictions for security
   - Folder structure based on audit IDs

4. **Integration Setup**:
   - Supabase SSR client for Next.js App Router
   - Separate clients for browser/server/middleware
   - Type-safe database queries with generated types
   - Setup script for easy configuration

**Files Created**:
- `supabase/migrations/20250111_initial_schema.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250111_storage_buckets.sql`
- `frontend/src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`
- `frontend/src/types/database.types.ts`
- `docs/supabase-setup.md`
- `scripts/setup-supabase.sh`

**Next Steps**:
- US-001-005: Basic Authentication (Clerk integration)

### January 11, 2025 - US-001-005: Basic Authentication

**Completed**:
- Integrated Clerk authentication with Next.js
- Created authentication middleware for route protection
- Implemented webhook handler for user sync with Supabase
- Built sign-in and sign-up pages with Clerk components

1. **Clerk Integration**:
   - ClerkProvider wrapping the app in layout.tsx
   - Middleware protecting dashboard and API routes
   - Pre-built UI components for auth flows
   - Automatic redirect after authentication

2. **User Synchronization**:
   - Webhook endpoint at `/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - Handles user.created, user.updated, user.deleted events

   - Maintains clerk_id for RLS policies

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Middleware configuration with route matchers
   - Dashboard routes require authentication
   - API routes protected by default
   - Public routes explicitly allowed

4. **Developer Experience**:
   - useCurrentUser hook for easy user data access
   - Type-safe user queries with generated types
   - Server and client component patterns documented
   - Clear separation of auth concerns
