# US-001-002: Development Environment Setup - Completion Report

**Story**: As a developer, I want a fully configured development environment so I can start building features efficiently.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (January 6, 2025)

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Dependency Management
- Resolved all npm dependency conflicts
- Downgraded to compatible versions:
  - React 18.3.1 (from 19.0.0)
  - Next.js 14.2.5 (from 15.3.3)
  - Tailwind CSS 3.4.0 (from 4.0)
  - ESLint 8.57.0 (from 9.0)

### 2. Configuration Files
- Created `tailwind.config.js` with v3 syntax
- Updated `postcss.config.mjs` for v3 plugins
- Converted `next.config.ts` to `next.config.js`
- Updated `globals.css` with v3 Tailwind directives
- Fixed Husky configuration for monorepo

### 3. Environment Variables
- Created `.env.local` from template
- Added placeholder values with instructions
- Documented where to obtain credentials:
  - Clerk: https://dashboard.clerk.com
  - Supabase: https://supabase.com/dashboard
  - Inngest: https://inngest.com

### 4. Docker Setup
- Created `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL
- Configured health checks and volumes
- Created `docker/README.md` with usage instructions

### 5. Development Verification
- Confirmed `npm install` completes successfully
- Verified development server starts on port 3000
- Tested with `test-dev-server.sh` script

## Technical Details

### Package.json Changes
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "next": "14.2.5"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.0",
    "eslint": "^8.57.0",
    "eslint-config-next": "14.2.5"
  }
}
```

### File Structure Created
```
/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── docker/
│   └── README.md
├── frontend/
│   ├── .env.local
│   ├── tailwind.config.js
│   └── next.config.js (renamed from .ts)
```

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Dependency Conflicts**: React 19 incompatible with Storybook 7
2. **Configuration Format**: Next.js 14 requires CommonJS config
3. **Tailwind Syntax**: v4 syntax not compatible with current tooling
4. **Husky Installation**: Subdirectory installation required special config

## Testing Performed

- ✅ npm install completes without errors
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Environment variables template created

## Next Steps

The development environment is now ready for:
1. Adding Clerk authentication keys
2. Configuring Supabase connection
3. Starting feature development
4. Running Storybook for component development

## Documentation Updated

- ✅ `docs/dev-environment-setup.md` - Added troubleshooting section
- ✅ `docs/frontend-package-updates.md` - Added compatibility notes
- ✅ `docs/technical-tasks.md` - Added completed environment tasks
- ✅ `docs/planning-journal.md` - Documented decisions and challenges
